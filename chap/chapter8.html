      Chapter 8. Information Security and Cyber Law
    </h1>
    <h1>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its social impacts</h1>
    <p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is the combined form of
      Information and Communication Technology, which is highly used for information flow and in many other fields. IT
      has made the world closer day by day. One can easily send and receive messages throughout the world within a
      second. It has been widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. It is being used
      as a learning and teaching tool in the education sector. Distance learning has become possible due to the
      advancement of IT. It has been highly used in industries to control the quantity and quality of products. It is
      equally used for management in hospitals and for the treatment of patients. IT is being used in the animation and
      entertainment sectors. Scientists can use computers or IT for their research and experiments. Space technology has
      become possible due to IT. Thus, it has had a positive impact on society. However, it has some negative impacts as
      well. As the use of IT increases, cybercrimes are also on the rise. Cybercriminals can easily steal othersâ€™
      information or data, disclose secrecy, and spread viruses in the network, disturbing social peace and security.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Security</h2>
    <p>As we know, in a network or cyberspace, there is always a threat of cyberattacks which may lead to the loss and
      damage of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activity. We
      need to adopt different measures while using a computer to protect ourselves from intentional and accidental
      activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from
      unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. We can use several physical and
      software preventive measures to protect ourselves from unethical activities. Information security helps create a
      secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>

    <p>Information security can mitigate security threats and attacks. A security threat is a possible danger that might
      cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and cause possible harm, whereas a security
      attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter others' valuable data and
      information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and
      worms.</p>

    <p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It means information is available only to authorized individuals. No one can
        use or process others' information without proper authorization.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> It indicates accuracy and completeness of data, meaning that data and information
        cannot be tampered with without proper authorization.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> It means information must always be available as per the user's requirements.
        It refers to accessing valuable data and information whenever required without delay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cryptography</h2>
    <p>Cryptography is derived from the Greek word meaning "Secret writing." Cryptography is the art and science of
      hiding information. It provides security for information and is used for secure communication between individuals,
      government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography mainly refers to encryption and decryption. Encryption is
      the process of converting plaintext (a message) into an unreadable format so that anyone who tries to see the
      message cannot read the original message. The plaintext is converted into unreadable text using special algorithms
      and keys. The unreadable text is called ciphertext. These ciphertexts are converted back into readable form
      through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also
      termed encoding or enciphering, and its reverse process (decryption) is called decoding or deciphering.</p>

    <h2>B. Short Answer Questions</h2>

    <p><strong>1. What challenges are we facing to create digital society in the Nepalese context?</strong></p>
    <p>Nepal faces challenges like poor digital infrastructure, limited internet access in rural areas, lack of digital
      literacy, cybercrime risks, and insufficient government policies for digital transformation.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What is computer ethics? What are the commandments of computer ethics?</strong></p>
    <p>Computer ethics is the set of moral guidelines that govern the use of computers. The commandments include not
      using computers to harm others, steal, snoop, or spread false information. It also emphasizes respecting privacy,
      intellectual property, and others' work.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Discuss about the role of computer ethics in the formation of secure and reliable digital
        society.</strong></p>
    <p>Computer ethics promote responsible behavior among users, helping to prevent cybercrimes, protect privacy, and
      build a trustworthy digital environment for communication, commerce, and governance.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Explain the basic principles/components of information security.</strong></p>
    <p>The key components are Confidentiality (keeping data private), Integrity (ensuring data isn't altered),
      Availability (ensuring access to data), Authentication (verifying identity), and Non-repudiation (proof of
      action).</p>

    <p><strong>5. Define cyber law. What are the major fields of cyber law?</strong></p>
