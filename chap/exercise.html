        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>

        <h3>a. Variable</h3>
        <p>
            A variable is a named memory location used to store data that
            can be modified during the execution of a program. It allows
            dynamic assignment of values based on conditions, user inputs,
            or calculations done by the system.
        </p>

        <h3>b. Expression</h3>
        <p>
            An expression is a valid combination of variables, constants,
            operators, and functions that produces a single value when
            evaluated. It is essential for performing operations, assigning
            values, and controlling flow within a program.
        </p>

        <h3>c. Identifier</h3>
        <p>
            An identifier is the name assigned to elements like variables,
            functions, arrays, or structures in a program. It must start
            with a letter or an underscore and should not match any of the
            language's reserved keywords.
        </p>

        <h3>d. Keyword</h3>
        <p>
            A keyword is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning in
            the programming language. These words are used for defining the
            structure and syntax and cannot be used for variable or function
            names.
        </p>

        <h3>e. Constant</h3>
        <p>
            A constant is a value that does not change during the execution
            of a program. Once declared and assigned, its value remains
            fixed and is used to prevent accidental changes to critical
            data.
        </p>

        <h3>f. Operator</h3>
        <p>
            An operator is a symbol used to perform operations on variables
            and values. It includes arithmetic, logical, relational,
            bitwise, assignment, and other types, depending on the
            language's capabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>g. Data Type</h3>
        <p>
            A data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold, such
            as integers, floats, characters, or strings. It determines the
            size, range, and operations that can be performed on the
            variable.
        </p>

        <h3>h. Token</h3>
        <p>
            A token is the smallest unit of a program that the compiler
            recognizes. Examples include keywords, identifiers, constants,
            operators, and punctuation symbols, which together form the
            basic syntax of the language.
        </p>

        <h3>i. Compiler</h3>
        <p>
            A compiler is a software tool that translates source code
            written in a high-level programming language into machine code.
            It checks the code for syntax errors and generates executable
            files that can run independently.
        </p>

        <h3>j. Interpreter</h3>
        <p>
            An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line by
            line, converting it to machine code at runtime. Unlike a
            compiler, it does not produce a separate executable file but
            runs the code directly.
        </p>

        <h3>k. Header File</h3>
        <p>
            A header file is a file containing declarations of functions and
            macros. It is included in the source file using the #include
            directive and provides access to standard or custom library
            functions.
        </p>

        <h3>l. Bitwise Operator</h3>
        <p>
            Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual
            bits of data. These include AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and
            right shift, and they are mainly used for low-level programming
            and performance optimizations.
        </p>

        <h3>m. Type Conversion</h3>
        <p>
            Type conversion is the process of converting a variable from one
            data type to another. It can be implicit (automatic) or explicit
            (casted by the programmer) and is used when combining different
            data types in expressions.
        </p>

            and the responsible use of digital resources.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Long Questions</h2>

        <h3>
            a. What are the different types of errors in programming?
            Explain with examples.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Errors in programming can be categorized into three types:
            syntax errors, semantic errors, and runtime errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> These errors occur when the code
            violates the syntax rules of the programming language. The
            compiler detects these errors and prevents the program from
            compiling.
        </p>
        <pre>
            printf("Hello, World!")  // Missing semicolon
        </pre>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
            <strong>Semantic Errors:</strong> These errors happen when the
            code is syntactically correct but doesn’t perform as expected
            due to logical flaws.
        </p>
        <pre>
            int a = 5, b = 0;
            printf("%d", a / b);  
        </pre>
        <p>
            <strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> These errors occur when the
            program is running. They usually result from invalid operations
            such as dividing by zero, accessing memory incorrectly, or using
            null pointers.
        </p>
        <pre>
            int *ptr = NULL;
            printf("%d", *ptr);  
        </pre>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>
            b. Explain the different ways of adding CSS to an HTML file.
        </h3>
        <p>
            CSS can be added to an HTML file in three main ways: inline,
            internal, and external.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Inline CSS:</strong> This method involves adding CSS
            rules directly within HTML tags using the style attribute. It is
            useful for small, specific styling but not ideal for large
            projects.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>&lt;p style="color: blue;"&gt;This is blue text.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </pre>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
            <strong>Internal CSS:</strong> CSS is defined within a style
            block inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML
            document. This method is used when the styles apply to a
            specific page.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>&lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
              p {
                color: green;
              }
            &lt;/style&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is green text.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;</code>
        </pre>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
            <strong>External CSS:</strong> CSS is written in a separate .css
            file and linked to the HTML file using the
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. This method is best for large
            projects, as it separates content from design and allows for
            code reuse.
        </p>
        <pre>
        &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;

        <h3>
            c. What are the generations of computers? Discuss their key
            features and examples.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The history of computers is divided into five generations based
            on the technology used in their design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>First Generation (1940–1956):</strong> First-generation
            computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry, which made them
            large, slow, and power-hungry. They required a lot of space and
            generated heat, which made them difficult to maintain. The input
            was typically via punched cards, and output was through
            printouts. An example is the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical
            Integrator and Computer).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Second Generation (1956–1963):</strong> Transistors
            replaced vacuum tubes in second-generation computers, making
            them smaller, faster, and more reliable. They consumed less
            power and produced less heat. High-level programming languages
            like COBOL and FORTRAN were introduced. An example is the IBM
            1401.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Third Generation (1964–1971):</strong> Integrated
            circuits (ICs) replaced transistors, leading to more powerful
            and compact computers. Third-generation computers could handle
            more complex tasks and supported multitasking. High-level
            languages like FORTRAN and COBOL became more widespread.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fourth Generation (1971–Present):</strong>
            Microprocessors were introduced, which placed all components of
            a computer’s CPU on a single chip. This revolutionized the
            computer industry, leading to personal computers (PCs).
            Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the internet, and high-level
            programming languages became widespread. Examples include the
            Apple II and IBM PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):</strong> The
            focus of fifth-generation computers is on artificial
            intelligence (AI), machine learning, and robotics. These systems
            aim to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that
            require reasoning and decision-making. Examples include
            AI-driven systems like virtual assistants and autonomous
            vehicles.
